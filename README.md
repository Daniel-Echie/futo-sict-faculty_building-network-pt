# Faculty Network Simulation – Cisco Packet Tracer

This project simulates a robust, scalable, and modular enterprise network design for the **Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (FICT)** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The design follows core CCNA principles from CCNA-1 to CCNA-3.

## 📊 Project Features

* 📂 **Departmental VLANs**: CYB, CSC, IFT, SOE
* 📡 **Dynamic IP assignment** using DHCP for all end devices
* 🔄 **Inter-VLAN Routing** via Router-on-a-Stick and Layer 3 Switch
* 😊 **IP Phone support** with dedicated VLANs per department role
* 🌐 **Simulated Internet access** via NAT on Faculty Router
* 📆 **Future-ready design**: FHRP, STP, OSPF, Dual ISP
